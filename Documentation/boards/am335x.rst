Texas Instruments AM335x
========================

The Texas Instruments AM335x SoCs have a two-stage boot process. The first stage
loader, also known as MLO is loaded by the ROM code. The MLO loads the second stage
loader from the same medium.

Building barebox
----------------

The TI AM335x boards in barebox are covered by the ``am335x_mlo_defconfig``
for the MLO and ``am335x_defconfig`` for the regular barebox image. The
resulting images will be placed under ``images/``:

Some boards come in different variants, make sure to pick the correct one.

Starting and updating barebox
-----------------------------

SPI NOR and NAND
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The regular board images can be started from another bootloader, see
:ref:`second_stage`. The board should provide update handlers
to update (or initially install) barebox on SPI NOR or NAND, see :ref:`update`.

SD/MMC
^^^^^^

To start barebox from SD/MMC prepare a card with a FAT filesystem. Copy the MLO
file for your board to the card and name it ``MLO``. Copy the regular image
for your board to the card and name it ``barebox.bin``.
