MTD SPI driver for ST M25Pxx (and similar) serial flash chips
=============================================================

Additionally to the Linux bindings in ``dts/Bindings/mtd/jedec,spi-nor.txt``
the barebox driver has the following optional properties:

- use-large-blocks : Use large blocks rather than the 4K blocks some devices
                     support. 4K erase blocks do not work with UBIFS which needs
		     a minimum erase block size of 15360 bytes. Also bigger sectors
		     are faster to erase.
