	help
	  Say Y here if you are using Texas Instrument's AM35XX based platform

config OMAP_GPMC
	prompt "Support for GPMC configuration"
	bool
	default y
	help
	  Enable this if you use Texas Instrument's General purpose Memory
	  Controller(GPMC). GPMC allows you to configure devices such as NOR,
	  NAND, OneNAND etc.

config OMAP_BUILD_IFT
	prompt "build ift binary (MLO)"
	bool
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to build an MLO binary. On TI SoCs, this
	  binary is loaded to SRAM. It is responsible for initializing
	  the SDRAM and possibly chainloading a full-featured barebox.

config OMAP_BUILD_SPI
	prompt "build SPI binary"
	bool
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to build an barebox.spi image as used
	  on the AM35xx chips when booting from SPI NOR flash.

	prompt "barebox update SPI NOR MLO handler"
	bool
	depends on BAREBOX_UPDATE
	help
	  Say Y for barebox update SPI NOR MLO handler.
	  AM35xx, AM33xx chips use big endian MLO for SPI NOR flash.

config BAREBOX_UPDATE_AM33XX_NAND
	prompt "barebox update NAND handler"
	bool
	depends on BAREBOX_UPDATE
	help
	  Say Y for barebox update NAND handler. This update handler updates
	  4 default NAND xload slots with a single command.
	  The Handler also checks if the given image has a valid CH header.
	  This also includes a handler for updating the regular barebox binary
	  in NAND.

config BAREBOX_UPDATE_AM33XX_EMMC
	prompt "barebox update eMMC handler"
	bool
	depends on BAREBOX_UPDATE
	help
	  Say Y for barebox update eMMC handler.

config OMAP4_USBBOOT
	bool "enable booting from USB"
	default n
	depends on ARCH_OMAP4 && !MMU
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to be able to boot an OMAP4 cpu from USB.
	  You need the utility program omap4_usbboot to boot from USB.
	  Please read omap4_usb_booting.txt for more information.

config OMAP3_USBBOOT
	bool "enable booting from USB"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP3
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to be able to boot the 2nd stage via USB. This
	  works by transferring the 2nd stage image using the MUSB controller
	  which is already initialized by the ROM code. Use the omap3-usb-loader
	  tool selectable below to upload images.

config OMAP_SERIALBOOT
	bool "enable booting from serial"
	select XYMODEM
	select FS_RAMFS
	depends on ARCH_AM33XX && SHELL_NONE
	depends on !CONSOLE_NONE
