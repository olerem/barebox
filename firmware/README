This is where you need to place any firmware files that need to be built
into the boot image.

Note that if you need to place any files here, the resulting boot image
is not completely governed by the GPLv2, as used for the Barebox binary,
but will be subject to additional terms of use imposed by the various
licenses that apply to the firmware files.
